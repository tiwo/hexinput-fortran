hexinput-fortran
================

This is some code I've written in 2006 to provide hexadecimal input and output
to FORTRAN programs.

Written as an example of integrating C with FORTRAN for a friend of mine; it
contains a lot of comments in German.

Overview
========

* hexin.c -- Read hexadecimal input from stdin, with comments explaining usage
  and compiling

* hextest.f -- example of using hexin.c from FORTRAN

* hexout.f -- Write hexadecimal output to stdout, with a small example
